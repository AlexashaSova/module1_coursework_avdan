# Coursework project

## on the module 1 "The Datascientist's Toolbox"

The first step of this project is to load and analyze into account some
of the datasets from the pre-installed R package 'datasets'. The full
list of the packages, available at the named package is available in the
[**link to the R
documentation**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html).
From the named library I've decided to pick 2 datasets by my own
preferences to analyze data each of selected datasets contains.

> Respecting to the fact, that our knowledge is not deep enough to build

> of exploratory approach in order to find some possible dependencies on

-   The first dataset is pretty classical dataset for this subject area,
    **'iris'**. This dataset represents measurements of *sepal length,
    sepal width and peatl width* the three iris species: *setosa*,
    *virginica* and *versicolor*. There are 50 rows per each of the iris
    species in the dataset.

```{r}
# get the data of the whole dataset 
data("iris")
```

On the image below is represented top 12 rows of the iris dataset rows,
ordered by the index at the ascending order.

The next step is to obtain summary on the dataset. The following summary
contains values on the criteria, such as *minimum (Min.)*, *1st Quartile
(1st Qu.)* (i.e. 25% of data was taken under the produced value),
*Median* (can be named as a middle value of some numeric sequence),
*Mean* (average value), *3rd Quartile (3rd Qu.)* (i.e. 75% of data was
taken under the produced value), *maximum (Max.)* for numeric values and
number of occurencies of each value for string values (column
*'Species'* in *iris* dataset). Additionally, the range value can be
calculated if needed. However, without any certain question, needed to
be solved, these values are useless.

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

From the data below it is clear that all the metrics are calculated on
all the iris species. It would be more informative, if the metrics were
calculated on the certain needed iris type. Assume, we need to get some
metrics on the iris *setosa*. Let's create dataframe with *setosa*
values **only**.

```{r}
# attaching library dplyr to use filter() function
library(dplyr)
# to make it more usable to call the names of the columns making it to lowercase 
names(iris) <- tolower(names(iris))
# creating dataframe with setosa rows only
setosa <- filter(iris, species == "setosa")
# show top-6 values of the obtained dataframe ordered by the ascending of the index
head(setosa)
```

The next step is obtaining summary metrics on the measurements of different *setosa* flowers. 
According to the data of the column *'species'* there are no other data here, except of *setosa* data. The obtained metrics' data also differ from the previously obtained.

```{r}
summary(setosa)
```



------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The second dataset is

```{r}
data("airmiles")
plot(airmiles)

```

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("AirPassengers")
#summary(iris)
```

```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
```

```{r}
plot(iris)
```
